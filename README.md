Klog is an open source Cloud Gaming Service building on [WebRTC](https://github.com/pion) using browser as the main platform.  
  
Klog aims to bring the most convenient gaming experience to gamer. You can play any games on your browser directly, which is fully compatible on multi-platform like Desktop, Android, IOS. This flexibility enables modern online gaming experience to retro games starting with NES in this current release.  

Note: The current state of Klog are not optimized for production. The service will still experience lag under heavy traffic. You can try hosting your own service following the instruction in the next session.

## Feature
1. Cloud gaming: Game logic is hosted on a remote server. User doesn't have to install or setup anything. Images and audio are streamed to user in the most optimal way.
2. Cross-platform compatibility: The game is run on webbrowser, the most universal builtin app. No console, plugin, external app or devices are needed. The device must support webRTC to perform streaming. Joystick is also supported.
3. Vertically scaled: We can add more machines to handle more traffic. The closest server with highest free resource will be assigned to user (In development).
4. Cloud storage: Game state is storing on online storage, so you can come back to continue playing in a game.

## Run on local by Docker

You try hosting the server yourself by running `./run_local_docker.sh`. It will spawn a docker environment and you can access the emulator on `localhost:8000`.  

## Development environment

Install Golang https://golang.org/doc/install . Because the project uses GoModule, so it requires Go1.11 version.

Install dependencies  

  * Install [libvpx](https://www.webmproject.org/code/) and [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
```
# Ubuntu
apt-get install -y pkg-config libvpx-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev

# MacOS
brew install libvpx pkg-config libopus libopusfile

# Windows
... not tested yet ...
```

And run 
  * `./run_local.sh`
  * The scripts includes build the binary using Go module

## FAQ

### How the project start?

- The project is inspired from Google Stadia. The most important question come to everyone mind is how good is the latency? Will the game experience is affected? I did some researches on that topic and WebRTC seems to be the most suitable protocol for that purpose. I limited the project scope and made a POC of Cloud-gaming. The result indeed looks very promising.  

### Why the game is lag for some people?

- Cloud-gaming is very network-sensitive. It requires the server is close to user, so please pick the nearest server to you.
- Cloud-gaming is based on WebRTC peer to peer, so there are some cases direct communication is not possible because of firewall. In that case, relay communication happens and the game is not smooth. You can find a public network and retry.
- The current state of project is hosted on limited resource, so during high traffic, the game might got lag due to CPU is overused, not because of network. Besides, my memory management is not working properly sometimes and game sessions are not fully separated, so the game session can lag overtime. In that case, please reload or continue your game by clicking share and reopen the old game.

### Why NES not some high graphic game?

- For the purpose of latency demostration and fast iteration, I picked NES but intergrating with other emulator like GBA, NDS and even Playstation is also possible. For High-end games, there will be problems with hardware and infrastructure. Google has a lot of resource and its distributed GPU will enhance this cloud-gaming usecase. My resource is not abundant, so NES emulator is a good choice for my first step.

### How good is the result

- My caliberation is that it requires 10 Mbps per NES game session ()
